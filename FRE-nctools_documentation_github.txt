Available in FRE-NCtools:

### Grid Tools Complete Description

1.Check_mask

   check_mask is used to configure the processors which contains all land points to be    
   masked out for ocean model (--model ocean). It also is used to configure the           
   processors which contains all ocean points to be masked out for land model             
   (--model land). This program is supposed to run on single processor. This tool will    
   print out number of processors to be masked, layout of the domain, masked out          
   processors list. These information will be written into files, with file name is       
   mask_table.n_mask.layout(1)Xlayout(2). The model is expected to read file mask_table   
   if you want to mask out some processors.                                               
                                                                                          
   The ocean model is assumed to be logically rectangular grid and land model could be    
   multiple tiles grid (like cubic shpere grid with 6 tiles). For land model, each        
   processor list has three entries: layout position in x-direction, layout position in   
   y-direction and tile number. For ocean model, each processor list has two entries:     
   layout position in x-direction, layout position in y-direction.                        
                                                                                          
   The purpose of using mask domain is to decrease the processor usage without            
   decreasing the performance, without changing bits relative to the case run without the 
   mask domain option. The mask domain option acts to mask out regions that have zero     
   ocean points (i.e., points that are all land) in both the ocean and sea ice models or  
   mask out regions that have zero land points (i.e., points that are all ocean) in land  
   model                                   

2.Make_Remap_File

  This program creates remap file from Cubic sphere grid to Cubic sphere grid.
  The ratio of grid size of input and output grid must be integer. The purpose
  of this tool is to create remap file on single processor for very high resoluton
  grid ( It will large processor count and long time to create such file ). Currently
  this tool can only remap file for data on grid cell center.

3.Frigrid

This program remaps (scalar or vector) data from the input grid to the output grid.

4.Make_coupler_mosaic

  This program Modifies land grid to match ocean grid at coast and calculate atmos/land,
  atmos/ocean, and land/ocean overlaps using the Sutherland-Hodgeman polygon
  clipping algorithm.

5.Make_hgrid 

  This program generates various types of horizontal grids in netCDF file format.

6.Make_land_domain

  This tools makes sure land_mask and land_ntile are consistent and pack the grid tile information into unstructured grid.

7.Make_quick_mosaic

  Make_quick_mosaic generates a complete grid a FMS coupler. When --ocean_topog  
  is not specified, it takes a coupled mosaic as input_mosaic. Otherwise it     
  takes a solo mosaic as input_mosaic. The atmosphere, ocean and land grid will 
  be the same. The land/sea mask will be decided by the land/sea mask of        
  input_mosaic if ocean_topog is not specified, otherwise by the ocean_topog    
  file.  

8.Make_topog

  Make_topog can generate topography for any Mosaic. The output file                    
  will contains the topography for each tile in the Mosaic. The field name in           
  the output topography file will be depth_tile# and it is positive down.               
  The topography data will be defined on model grid, the model grid size will be        
  supergrid grid size divided by refinement (x_refine, y_refine, default is 2).         
  --mosaic is a required option and all other options are optional, but                 
  some options are required depending on the choice of topog_type.

9.Make_vgrid

  Make_vgrid is used to make a vertical grid for an FMS model.  It uses         
  a piecewise monotonic shape preserving cubic-spline algorithm to             
  calculate the grid cell location.  The output netcdf file contains            
  information on the  supergrid with grid size equal to the model grid size    
  multiplied by a refinement factor of two.

10.Remap_land

  Remap_land remaps land restart-file from one mosaic grid to another mosaic grid.

11.River_regrid 

  River_regrid will remap river network data from global regular lat-lon grid onto any  
  other grid (includes regular lat-lon grid and cubic grid ), which is specified        
  through option --mosaic.

12.River_runoff

  This tool remaps runoff data from a spherical grid onto any grid (spherical or tripolar) using conservative scheme.

13.Transfer_to_mosaic_grid 

  Transfer_to_mosaic_grid transfers previous version grid file (The grid file 
  has field x_T.y_T ) into a mosaic grid. The input file could be a ocean    
  only grid or a coupled grid.    

### Combine Tools Complete Description

1.Combine_Blobs

  Combine_Blobs holds metadata information related to netcdf files and information necessary to extract slices of arrays.
  Calculate the size of all variables based on their dimensions.
  Then, lastly combines the MOM5 Lagrangian Blobs netCDF files.

2.Combine_restarts

  Combine_restart combines restart files generated by a FMS enabled model. This tool will use the correct combine utility (*mppnccombine*
  or *combine-ncc*) to combine any restart files that reside in the currrent working directory.  *combine_restarts* uses the same options used
  in the FRE workflow.

3.Iceberg_comb

  Iceberg_comb takes a list of FMS iceberg restart files, and combines them using the NCO record concatenation utility *ncrcat*.  It
  checks the list of _<in_file>_ to determine if they actually contain
  any icebergs prior to performing the *ncrcat*.

4.Combine-ncc

  Combine-ncc combines distributed unstructured FMS grid netCDF files. This program reads several input netcdf files, presumably containing
  compressed by gathering" data, and combines them into a single output file.  This tool opens all input files and determine the creation mode of output file:
  if any of the input files is 64-bit then the output is 64-bit as well, otherwise it's 32-bit.


5.Decompress-ncc

  This tool converts an unstructured FMS grid file to a standard lat-lon grid. This program also reads several input netcdf files, presumably containing "compressed
  by gathering" data, and combines them into a single output file.

6.Mppnccombine 

  This tool combines destributed FMS netCDF files. This tool joins together netCDF data files representing a decomposed
  domain into a unified netCDF file.  It was originally designed to be used as a postprocessor for the parallel I/O
  programming interface "mpp_io_mod".

7.Is-compressed 

  This tool determines if a netCDF file has an unstructured FMS grid. This utility tests if any of the variables 
  in the given netcdf file are compressed-by-gathering. It returns 0 if yes, and -1 otherwise.
  

### Statistical and Informational Tools Complete Description

1.list_ncvars 

 list_ncvars lists the variables in a netCDF file.

2.Plevel 
 
 Plevel interpolates data from model levels to pressure levels. The input model grid is a hybrid sigma-pressure coordinate
 and the output pressure levels may be specified. The minimum required input fields are "bk", "pk", and "ps".


3.Split_ncvars 

 Split_ncvars writes the variables in a FMS netCDF file into multiple netCDF files, one file per netCDf field.

4.Timavg 

 Timavg creates a time average netCDF file. This tool averages variables stored in netCDF format over the time axis.
 The script takes multiple netcdf files that all contain the same dimensions and variables but may have a different number of time
 records and writes a new netcdf file that has a time record averaged from each input file.

5.Ncexists 

 Ncexists checks for variables and attributes in a netCDF file.

### Hydrology Tools identified under simple_hydrog/post/cp_river_vars, simple_hydrog/rmvpr/rmv_parallel_rivers and simple_hydrog/lakes/cr_lake_files

1.Cp_river_vars 

 Cp_river_vars tool follows river downstream; get subA, travel, cell_length, and basin. 
 Then gets number of grid cells accepting drainage and checks for crossing of tocell paths. 
 Produces the number of cases of rivers crossing and computes basin area. Tool gets ordered list of drainage cells over land and ocean. 
 Then writes out number of basins having the same area and assigns basin values, creating drainage flag internal and extern basins.
 Lastly, creates new netCDF data set; overwrite existing dataset.

2.Rmv_parallel_rivers 

 Rmv_parallel_rivers tool eliminates cases of parallel rivers. River fields then are updated and iteration continues until no longer change.

3.Cr_lake_files

 Cr_lake_files tool adds GLCC Waterbod data. First reads glcc file -- get lats, lons, waterbod, pwetland and then tries averaging 0.125-degree data to 1-degree.
 Then gets lon and lat dims from first river file should be identical for all files and opens river files 
 read lat,lon grids, tocell, land_frac,  cellarea, and travel, then gets latitudes and longitudes of input river file.
 Tool interpolates glcc water bodies and permanent wetlands to model grid. Finally, creates new netCDF data set; overwrite existing dataset.



## Install

FRE-NCtools has a collection of C and Fortran sources.  Within GFDL, FRE-NCtools
is built using a recent version of the Intel C and Fortran compilers.  Using
other compilers (GCC/GFortran) is possible, but is not tested by the Modeling
Systems group at GFDL.

FRE-NCtools is built using the GNU Build System.  If you received this as a
package, the standard:

```
configure
make
make install
```

should be sufficient.  If you cloned the git repository, you must first run
the `autoreconf` command with the `--install` option to copy in the missing
autoconf files:

```
autoreconf -i
./configure
make
make install


Additionally, you will probably need to set the environment variable CONFIG_SITE
and set the recommended environment (modules):

```
export CONFIG_SITE=/path/to/package/site-configs/<site>/config.site
source /path/to/package/site-configs/<site>/env.sh
```

The above steps may need to be augmented depending upon your user evironment setup.
For example, if autoreconfig is in /home/MyUsername/FRE-NCtools, it will create the
configure command in this directory. You may tell the bash shell, for example,
the location of both by this command:

export PATH=/home/MyUsername/FRE-NCtools:$PATH

Additionally, installing into a non-default directory may be desired or neccesary.
For example, if the target directory is /home/MyUsername/bin, then FRE-NCtools
building is configured by:

autoreconf -i
./configure --prefix=/home/MyUsername/bin

Finally compile and install the tools as usual:

make
make install

Some FRE-NCtools applications can be run in parallel using MPI.  If the
`--with-mpi` option is given to `configure`, the MPI version of those
applications will be built.

A few site configurations, for GFDL managed systems, are available in the
[site-config](site-config) directory.  These can be used by setting the
`CONFIG_SITE` environment variable prior to running `configure`.
