# FRE-NCtools 

This repository will contain the FRE NCtools source and 
build instructions starting from bronx-10.  All previous
versions can be found in the CVS repository.  Use

```sh
cvs co -r testing_fre local/create
```

to view the checkout and compile scipt used for the that particular
version.

# Conversion from CVS to git

As this is a conversion from CVS to git, there will be many
commits that will not work properly.  If you find that the build
process is not functioning as expected, or the build script still
attempts to pull in source from CVS, please check that a newer
version is not available.

The final goal of this conversion is that that tag 'bronx-10' will
produce an identical tar file as the 'fre-nctools-bronx-10' CVS tag.
